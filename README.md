Yet another implementation of the a priori algorithm

It is planned that this module will construct the most frequent tuples. Additionally, I intend to return association rules together with their confidence, interest and lift.

Probably, the module will not be efficient in terms of computation time. However, the goal is to use the multiprocessing module and potentially pool the tasks to several workers.
